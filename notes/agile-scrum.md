Scrum is an agile way of project management. It is a framework for managing the software
development process.
It provides a skeleton to build the agile software development process adapted to
your company needs.

Scrum teams are supported by two important roles: the scrum master and the product owner.
The scrum master is the coach of the team and helps it perform at the highest level.
The product owner represents the business, the product, users and customers. They guide the
team to build the right product.



##Â Scrum development

Scrum uses iterations to evaluate and build the right product.
Iterations are timeboxed to at least one week to no more that a month.
At the start of the sprint the team members (dev team, product owner and scrum master) sit
together and discuss the items in the backlog. The dev team commits to building a limited set
of features during the sprint. A discussion about the features is held.
During the sprint the team builds the functionality, meaning it is tested, built and integrated
in a staging environment, ready to be demo`ed.
It is reccommended that at each day of the sprint the team attends a scrum meeting, to
solve problems and make impediments emerge. It is a cerimony to synchronize with the rest of the
team.
At the end of the iteration, a demo is held in front of the product owner, and anyone who wants to
attend to be up to date with the developmnet progress.
Also at the end of the sprint, a retrospective is held to further improve the team.
