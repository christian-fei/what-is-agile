we follow these principles:

- satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of working software
- business model and markets can change quickly, so we must welcome changing requirements
- deliver working software frequently (from weeks to months)
- business people and devlopers work daily together
- build projects around motivated individuals, give them the support they need to get the job done
- the most effective way to convey information is face-to-face communication
- working software is the primary measure of progress
- agile processes promote sustainable development
- agility comes from continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- simplicity is essential - maximizing the amount of work not done
- the best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
- at regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly
