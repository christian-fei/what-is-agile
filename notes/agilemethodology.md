## What is Agile?

It is an alternative to traditional project management.
It helps to respond to change and unpredictability, through incremental,
iterative work, called sprints.


## What is Scrum?

Scrum is the most popular framework to introduce agile in a project or company.
It is based on empirical feedback about the product, team self management, and 
focus on building well tested software in short increments of the product.

Scrum has three roles: product manager, scrum master and the development team.
Scrum has five cerimonies: backlog refinement/grooming, sprint planning,
daily scrum, sprint review/demo and sprint retrospective.


## Where did Agile come from?

It goes back to 1970, where Dr. Royce adviced against sequential development of software
in a paper entitled "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems".
It states that software should not be built like an automobile on the assembly line,
constantly waiting for the previous phase to continue the development.
He advised against the phase based approach where developers first gather all the requirements,
then complete all the architecture, then test, and so on.
Royce reasoned this by recalling the lack of communication by the business people and developers
during each phase.

Agile methodology is a reaction to the argument that developers cannot identify the requirements
(and neither do business people) before the software is up and running, ready to be tested and explored.
Since markets and business ideas change, software cannot be built and designed up front, it is needed to
be an incremental approach where changes and refinements are welcome.

Otherwise it could happed that at the end of a project the software is built like it was supposed to (initially),
but now the market and customers needs something else and the software is completely useless and 
was a waste of money and time.


## Why Agile?

Agile provides recurring periods where the software can be adapted and improved, based on the
new requirements and ideas.
