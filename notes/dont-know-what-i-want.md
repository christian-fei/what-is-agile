## Iterating and incrementing are separate ideas

Most often when people say "iteration" in Agile development, they mean "increment".

Because:

by incrementally developing software we mean incrementally add software functionality a time.
It`s like building a brick wall. At the end you have a working wall, you see it rise during the process.

by iteratively developing software we mean that we build something, evaluate if it works for us,
then we make changes to it and adapt. Like painters draw their artworks.


## We increment for multiple reasons

- to gradually build up functionality, so that if development takes longer than expected, we can release the product increment
- to get the business value we are chasing. this we do not get any return on investment until the customers can use the product.


## It Doesn’t Mean What You Think It Means

"At the end of every iteration you'll have a potentially shippable product".
For a customer this means the product has the minimal set of features to make customers happy
and get a return on investment.
For developer this means constant high code quality and good coverage of the system.


## YAGRI: You Ain’t Gunna Release It

Alistair suggests to [write three stories instead of just one](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Three+cards+for+user+rights)
so that the product owner doesn`t have the fear and stress to get the one story completely right and correct.
He suggests to write the first story card with the actual story, the second one with a placeholder for 
the potential changes in the future to the story, and the third one with fine-tunings.

This is an example of planning to iterate.
