user stories should facilitate discussion about the desired functionality and requirements.

What are user stories? User stories are short and simple descriptions of a feature, from
the perspective of the user or customer of the system.

A template that you can follow is:

```
As a TYPE_OF_USER, I want SOME_GOAL, so that SOME_REASON.
```

User stories shift the focus from writing about the requirements to discussing and
understanding them.

Too large user stories (that cannot be completed in an iteration, or simply contain a lot 
of functionality), are called epics.

Who can write user stories? Everyone on the team.

User stories are written throughout the life span of the project.
At the beginning of a project, a story-writing workshop is held to gather enough
functionality and knowledge about the product to start working on some functionality.
The backlog grows and gets curated during the project lifespan. The grooming is done by the 
product owner by discussing with the team about the functionality.

What is a product backlog? It is a prioritized list of the functionality to be developed
for the product or service. Product backlog items can be in any form the team prefers,
although user stories have emerged as the preferred and most popular form of backlog items.

It is important to note that written part of an user story is totally pointless if there
hasn`t been any form of discussion.
