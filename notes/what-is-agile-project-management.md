in an agile team lead with scrum there are three roles: the scrum master, 
product owner and the team.

the product owner is responsible for the business aspect of the product being built,
building the right product, and in the right order/priority.

the scrum master helps the team to build the product right, helping team eliminate
obstacles, facilitating discussions/retrospectives, and tracking progress.

the team members work together to achieve the product goals, in the best way possible,
with shared techical practices and excellence.
