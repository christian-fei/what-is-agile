you can think of agile as "a way of doing work".
originally it has been applied to the software world, but it can be applied to almost anything
where you can iteratively get closer to what the customer wants, with its feedback.

in the right circumstances, working in an agile way can:

- reduce waste
- shorten the time-to-market
- lower costs
- identify problems sooner, and mitigate risks



### waterfall

with waterfall things are meant to happen in sequence. You finish a thing, before
you can move to the next one. Gathering requirements, design, implementation, test, maintenance.


### What are the ideal conditions for transitioning to an agile way of working?

- when you don`t know your product or market yet. if there`s a lot of stuff you don`t know.

- openness: the client needs to be able to listen to people, and adapt new processes
